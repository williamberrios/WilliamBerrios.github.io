Hi, I am a bachelor in mechatronic engineering. Recently,  Previously, I completed my bachelor at [National University of Engineering - Peru](https://www.uni.edu.pe/) where I was advised by Prof.[Alberto Coronado](https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm William, a bachelor in Mechatronics Engineering (Robotics ðŸ¤–) from [UNI](https://www.uni.edu.pe/). Currently, I am working as a research intern at the [The Center for Brains, Minds & Machines - MIT](https://cbmm.mit.edu/) working with [Arturo Deza](http://arturodeza.wikidot.com/) examining the potential of Visual Transformers and adversarial training on the modeling of the ventral stream processing. Previously, I worked as a computer vision research intern developing a deep active learning framework to help curators efficiently label biomedical images at the [Electronic Visualization Laboratory](https://www.evl.uic.edu/)  under the supervision of Professor [Elisabeta Marai](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/g-marai/).

My research interests lie in building robust and generalizable computer vision systems with minimal or no supervision. Specific areas of interest are representation learning, generative modeling, few-shot learning, adversarial robustness and robotics.

Eager to contribute to science development in Peru, I am actively organizing meetings with graduate students in computer science at [REPU](https://www.repuprogram.org/) for peruvian undergraduates. This year, I am looking forward to pursuing a **PhD in Computer Science**  and becoming a **first-generation graduate student** in my family.
