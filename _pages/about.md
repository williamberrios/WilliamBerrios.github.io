Hi, I am a former research intern at the [Electronic Visualization Lab]from University of Illinois at Chicago advised by [Prof. Elisabeta Marai](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/g-marai/). I graduated with a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering from [National University of Engineering](https://www.uni.edu.pe/){:target="\_blank"} - Lima, Peru in 2019. There, I was adviced by [Prof. Alberto Coronado](https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado){:target="\_blank"} working on machine learning detection of mechanical failures.

My research interests are machine learning, computer vision, few-shot learning, deep unsupervised learning and robotics. I am looking forward to pursue a Phd in Computer Science :)

Hi, I am recent graduate from mechatronics engineering. Recently, I worked as a computer vision research intern at [Electronic Visualization Laboratory](https://www.evl.uic.edu/)  under the supervision of Prof. [Elisabeta Marai](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/g-marai/). Previously, I completed my bachelor at [National University of Engineering - Peru](https://www.uni.edu.pe/) where I was advised by Prof.[Alberto Coronado](https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado){:target="\_blank"}.

Eager to contribute to science development in Peru, I am helping organize meetings and conversations with graduate students in computer science at [REPU](https://www.repuprogram.org/). This year, I am looking forward to pursuing a **PhD in Computer Science**  and becoming a **first-generation graduate student** in my family.
