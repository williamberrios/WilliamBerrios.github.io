Hi, I am a former research intern at the [Electronic Visualization Lab](https://www.evl.uic.edu/) from University of Illinois at Chicago advised by [Prof. Elisabeta Marai](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/g-marai/). I graduated with a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering from [National University of Engineering](https://www.uni.edu.pe/){:target="\_blank"} - Lima, Peru in 2019. There, I was adviced by [Prof. Alberto Coronado](https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado){:target="\_blank"} working on machine learning detection of mechanical failures.
My research interests are deep unsupervised learning.
