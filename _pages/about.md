Hi, I am a former research intern at the [Electronic Visualization Lab](https://www.evl.uic.edu/) from University of Illinois at Chicago advised by [Prof. Elisabeta Marai](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/g-marai/). I graduated with a B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering from [National University of Engineering](https://www.uni.edu.pe/){:target="\_blank"} - Lima, Peru in 2019. There, I was adviced by [Prof. Alberto Coronado](https://pe.linkedin.com/in/albertocoronado){:target="\_blank"} working on machine learning detection of mechanical failures.
My research interests are deep unsupervised learning.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
